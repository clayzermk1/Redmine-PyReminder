Unfortunately, I do not\r\nknow Ruby and despite trying my best to decipher the plugin's code, could not\r\nfully grasp the workings of the rake script. So I set about building one in\r\nPython that included the requested features.\r\n\r\nPyReminder will send emails to each Redmine user reminding them of a\r\nconfigurable set of issues.\r\n\r\nPyReminder is a Python script that is set up as a cron task. All configuration\r\noptions are passed via the command line. The script will make several queries\r\nto the Redmine database and send out emails based on the results.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n### Requirements\r\nTested against:\r\n* python 2.4.3\r\n* MySQL-python 1.2.1-1\r\n* Redmine 1.2.1\r\n* mysql Ver 14.12 Distrib 5.0.77, for redhat-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 5.1\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nOn EL5 Linux:\r\n```\r\ncd /etc/cron.daily\r\nln -s /path/to/redmine_pyreminder_cron.sh redmine_pyreminder\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit redmine_pyreminder_cron.sh and configure it for your database,\r\nSMTP server, and desired notificaitons.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nThe script has built in help that is accessible by passing it the ``-h`` or ``--help`` \r\noptions.\r\n\r\nThere are three catagories of issues: overdue, current, and starting.\r\nOverdue issues are issues that have assigned due dates in the past that are\r\nstill \"open\".\r\nCurrent issues are issues that have an assigned due date from today through the\r\nnext 7 days (i.e. issues that will be due within 7 days).\r\nStarting issues are issues that have an assigned start date between today\r\nthrough the next 7 days (i.e. issues that will be starting within 7 days).\r\n\r\nOptionally you can enable or disable watched issues matching the same criteria.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to test the script without blasting every user in your\r\ndatabase, you can use the ``-t USERID``, ``--test_user=USERID`` options to specify a\r\nsingle user to send the email to.\r\n\r\n## Release History\r\nNothing yet\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Clay Walker  \r\nLicensed under the GPLv2 only license.\r\n\r\n"}
